                            I am a senior at Penn State University majoring in 
                            Information, Science, and Technology with a focus on 
                            application development. I have extensive real world experience in 
                            security, distribution and manufacturing. This 
                            experience enables me to have a unique
                            point of view in multiple areas where technology is implemented.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will graduate with a BA in December of 2023. I enjoy learning new
                            technologies and development software. I have extensive experience with
                            multiple programs such as IntelliJ, NetBeans, Adobe XD, Andriod Studio, XCode, 
                            ESRI products, ArcGIS, and MSOffice365. I have 2 years experience in Java, HTML, and CSS. I have over 1 year experience 
                            in GIS mapping, data entry, and data procurement.

                                This was many years ago but I learned concepts of design and color theory.

                                I learned the concepts of design and that has been expanded upon with
